| Issue                    | Description                                                                                                                                           | Status                                                                        |

| **Environment Access**   | AI Assistant is currently the only control interface for your environments. **Write down your environment URLs and deployment ID** - don't lose them! | We'll be releasing UI/MCP enhancements shortly!                               |
| **Java Code Generation** | LLM-generated code may not always compile. Usually obvious to fix.                                                                                    | Should get better as we improve our prompts                                   |
| **Auth0 Logouts**        | Unexpected session terminations, possibly related to idle times.                                                                                      | We're only monitoring this at the moment.                                     |
| **Network Outages**      | Occasional connectivity loss between Cloudflare Tunnel and Kubernetes cluster. Few minutes, few times daily.                                          | Working with Hetzner. We might just restructure the internal network routing. |
| **Transactional Deletions** | Deleting large amounts of data is slow, slightly slower than data saves.                                                                              | It's in the backlog, but resolution probably not before end of Alpha Phase.   |
