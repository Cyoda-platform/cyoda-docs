| Issue                     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Status                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| **Environment Access**    | [AI Assistant](https://ai.cyoda.net) is currently the only control interface for your environments. When you've logged in, it will give you your env details if prompted. But it's best to **write down your environment URL**                                          | We'll be releasing better options soon                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **Java Code Generation**  | Generating your code-base may take a while (15-30 minutes). Please be patient. In rare cases it might not compile, but it's usually obvious to fix.                                                                                                                     | Should get better as we improve the agentic workflow and prompts                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Deployments**                 | You can prompt the  [AI Assistant](https://ai.cyoda.net) to deploy your environment to pick up the latest Cyoda version. **BEWARE**: This will reset all your data. And, might contain breaking changes in Alpha/Beta, such that your client compute node may not work. | We'll announce breaking changes in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/95rdAyBZr2) channel. This is Alpha. You'll usually just need to merge the latest changes from the template projects to your codebase, and maybe adjust a few things. |
| **Auth0 Logouts**         | Unexpected session terminations, possibly related to idle times.                                                                                                                                                                                                        | We're only monitoring this at the moment.                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| **Transactional Deletions** | Deleting large amounts of data is slow, slightly slower than data saves.                                                                                                                                                                                                | It's in the backlog, but resolution probably not before end of Alpha Phase.                                                                                                                                                              |
