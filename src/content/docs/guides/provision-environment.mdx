## Create a Technical User

**Create a technical user (M2M client)**: Prompt the AI Assistant with: "Please create a technical user for my environment". You will see a button to launch the query against your env to create a new user. Write down the client ID and secret - you'll need them to access your environment.

## Access the Environment
Once your environment is deployed and you have a technical user, you can access your environment.

### Via the Cyoda UI

Just navigate to your environment URL in your favorite browser at `https://client-<your_caas_user_id>.eu.cyoda.net`
You can find your environment URL from the previous steps or ask the AI Assistant for the url
