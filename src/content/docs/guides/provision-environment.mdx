## Know your Environment

Prompt the AI Assistant with: `What is my environment URL?`. Wait a bit.

## Create a Technical User

**Create a technical user (M2M client)**: Prompt the AI Assistant with: "Add machine user".
You will see a button to launch the query against your env to create a new user.
Write down the client ID and secret - you'll need them to access your environment.

## Access the Environment
Once your environment is deployed and you have a technical user, you can access your environment.

### Via the Cyoda UI

Just navigate to your environment URL in your favorite browser at `https://client-<your_caas_user_id>.eu.cyoda.net`
You can find your environment URL from the previous steps or ask the AI Assistant for the url

With the Cyoda UI you need to login with your personal via Auth0.

### Via the API
To access the APIs you need to use your technical user credentials to authenticate.
