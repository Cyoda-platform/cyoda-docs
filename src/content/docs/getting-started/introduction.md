# Introduction to Cyoda

Welcome to the Cyoda Platform, a revolutionary approach to building modern, intelligent applications through entity-driven architecture and event-based workflows.

## What is Cyoda?

Cyoda is a cloud-native platform that fundamentally reimagines how applications are built and operated. At its core, Cyoda implements an **Entity Database Management System (EDBMS)** that tightly couples data with the business logic that governs its evolution.

### Key Principles

**Entity-Centric Design**
Every piece of data in Cyoda is modeled as an entity with a well-defined lifecycle, state transitions, and business rules. This approach mirrors how businesses naturally think about their operations.

**Event-Driven Architecture**
All changes in the system are driven by events, creating a fully traceable and auditable system where every state transition is recorded and can be replayed.

**AI-Native Platform**
Cyoda's structured, declarative approach makes it uniquely suited for AI-assisted development, where AI systems can understand, generate, and modify business logic effectively.

## Why Choose Cyoda?

### For Developers
- **Simplified Architecture**: Focus on business logic instead of infrastructure plumbing
- **Built-in Observability**: Every entity change is automatically tracked and auditable
- **AI-Assisted Development**: Leverage AI to generate services, validate models, and implement logic
- **Rapid Prototyping**: Declarative models enable fast iteration and experimentation

### For Businesses
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Built-in audit trails and time-travel capabilities
- **Operational Transparency**: Real-time visibility into business processes
- **Scalable Foundation**: Cloud-native architecture that grows with your needs
- **Future-Proof**: AI-ready platform that evolves with technological advances

## Core Concepts

### Entities
Independent units of business information with well-defined lifecycles. Examples include users, orders, applications, or any domain object relevant to your business.

### States and Transitions
Entities move through defined states via transitions triggered by events. This creates predictable, governable workflows that mirror real-world business processes.

### Workflows
Finite state machines that define the allowed transitions for entity types, capturing business rules and lifecycle management in a declarative format.

### Events and Processors
Events trigger state transitions, while processors execute the business logic associated with those transitions, enabling both synchronous and asynchronous processing patterns.
