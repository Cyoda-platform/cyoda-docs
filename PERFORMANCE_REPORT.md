## How to Run Performance Tests

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the required tools installed:
```bash
npm install -g lighthouse serve
```

### Available Test Commands

#### 1. Full Performance Audit (Interactive)
```bash
npm run perf:audit
```
This command will:
- Build the production version
- Start a local server on port 3000
- Run Lighthouse with budget validation
- Open the results in your browser
- Automatically clean up the server process

#### 2. Automated Performance Check (CI/CD)
```bash
npm run perf:check
```
This command will:
- Build the production version
- Run Lighthouse audit against localhost:3000
- Generate JSON report (`lighthouse-report.json`)
- Suitable for automated testing pipelines

#### 3. Manual Testing Steps
If you prefer to run tests manually:

1. **Build the site:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Serve the built site:**
   ```bash
   npx serve dist -l 3000
   ```

3. **Run Lighthouse (in another terminal):**
   ```bash
   lighthouse http://localhost:3000 --budget-path=performance-budget.json --view
   ```

4. **Clean up:**
   ```bash
   # Kill the serve process when done
   pkill -f 'serve dist'
   ```

### Understanding the Results

The performance budget is configured in `performance-budget.json` with these targets:
- **Timings**: FCP < 1.5s, LCP < 2.5s, CLS < 0.1, TTI < 3s
- **Resource Sizes**: JS < 100KB, Total < 500KB, Images < 200KB, CSS < 50KB
- **Resource Counts**: Scripts < 10, Stylesheets < 5, Images < 20

Budget violations will be highlighted in red in the Lighthouse report.

- **Resource Counts**: Scripts < 10, Stylesheets < 5, Images < 20

Budget violations will be highlighted in red in the Lighthouse report.

## Recommendations for Ongoing Performance
1. **Regular Audits**: Run `npm run perf:audit` before deployments
2. **Image Optimization**: Continue using WebP format for new images
3. **Bundle Monitoring**: Watch for JavaScript bundle size growth
4. **Core Web Vitals**: Monitor real-world performance metrics
5. **Caching Strategy**: Implement proper cache headers in production

## Conclusion
The performance optimization implementation successfully achieved all target metrics with a perfect Lighthouse score. The site now loads quickly, provides excellent user experience, and maintains visual stability throughout the loading process.
